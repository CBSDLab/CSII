# Cross-Sector Innovation Initiative (CSII)

The Cross-Sector Innovation Initiative (CSII), a collaborative project of the CHI Center and community partners, used community-based system dynamics to create a detailed understanding of structural racism impacts in Cuyahoga County. The resulting models are helping  identify actionable and transportable strategies and lever points for advancing equity.

The CHI Center was one of 10 CSII grantee projects nationwide from 2020 to 2022. The projects worked to build stronger, sustainable connections to better meet the goals and needs of the people they serve and ultimately improve health equity. Collaborations included representatives from public health, healthcare, social services, and community organizations. CSII was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and co-led by the Center for Sharing Public Health Services and the Public Health National Center for Innovations.
